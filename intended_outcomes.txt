POS System:

1. Should have there different user accounts (e.g. Admin, Manager, Cashier)

To do:
1. Add a logging system where every transaction (including manager and cashier) will be documented, and the admin can only see it
2. Optimize further the structure of the code
3. If the user is in the update product name, quantity, price page, the go back function should return on the update account or update product page
